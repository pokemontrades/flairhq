          This is a special website. It was created to scratch an itch. A very niche itch:
          the organisation of references for
          <a href="http://reddit.com/r/pokemontrades">/r/pokemontrades</a>
          and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/svexchange">/r/svexchange</a>.

          <a href="http://reddit.com/r/pokemontrades">/r/pokemontrades</a>
          and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/svexchange">/r/svexchange</a> use reference pages
          to determine eligibility for the flair images next to users' names. Here you can
          input all of the trades/hatches you have completed, and then submit your application
          for one of the many flair levels. You can read all about the flair guidelines on
          the subreddits' respective wikis.

        <h3>The Subreddits!</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="http://reddit.com/r/pokemontrades">/r/pokemontrades</a> is a place for trading,
          and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/svexchange">/r/svexchange</a> is a place for hatching
          shiny eggs. But really, if you don't know about the subs, you should go there first,
          not here. Why are you adding references if you haven't traded there yet?
