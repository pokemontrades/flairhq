                <h3>Reddit</h3>
                <p>FlairHQ uses Reddit to authenticate users. This is for 3 reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All our users are on Reddit (due to the usage of the site)</li>
                    <li>One less password for users to remember</li>
                    <li>We do not store any credentials for the
                        user that can't be easily revoked</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We use Reddit's authentication system, which means that we <strong>never have access to your password</strong>,
                    and you can revoke our access to your account at any time from the reddit settings.</p>
                <h4>Reddit Permissions</h4>
                <p>We only request permissions necessary for the site to function.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Access my reddit username and signup date</strong>
                        <p>We require this to tie you to a reddit account, this is
                            necessary for any Reddit oauth usage.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Select my subreddit flair. Change link flair on my submissions</strong>
                        <p>We require this to know what flair you currently have on the subreddits,
                            to ensure you don't apply for the same flair again.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Manage and assign flair in subreddits I moderate</strong>
                        <p>We require this for the mods to apply flair applications. We cannot
                            request this from only certain users, so it needs to be requested
                            from everyone.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Maintain this access indefinitely (or until manually revoked)</strong>
                        <p>We require this so you don't have to log in every time you access the site.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
                <p>FlairHQ uses Google Analytics to collect data about how users
                    use the site. This allows us to improve the site by seeing
                    what is confusing/unused and tailor the design best.</p>

                <h3>Other</h3>
                <p>
                    All other information we gather is the information you enter into the site
                    (this includes, but is not limited to: 3DS friend codes, links to trades,
                    in game names and any comments made). All of this information is publicly
                    viewable across the site by anyone.
